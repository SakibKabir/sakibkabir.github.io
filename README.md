## Projects
Software Engineering \
•	Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Pipeline Software Development and Deployment
-	Improved the Python and C++ codebase (100K+ lines of code) applying best practice coding methodologies.
-	Refactored a significant portion of the Python codebase to improve modularity so that different types of data can be processed from different sites and MRI scanners.
-	Heavily streamlined Python classes and methods to process and quantify MRI scans, reducing (if possible, eliminating) dependencies in the code.
-	Implemented plenty of unit testing procedures to make sure the analysis process is accurate and robust to numerous data from wide range of format and MR scanners. 
-	Integrated three different image processing and analysis pipelines in a single repository to process different images seamlessly from a single Graphical User Interface (GUI).
•	Human Lung Spectroscopy Quantification Pipeline Conversion to Python
-	Converted MATLAB codebase into Python using and creating equivalent functions. 
-	Refactored and streamlined more than 10,000+ lines of code repository to integrate into image analysis pipeline that is being used by about 10 different Medical Centers and Universities.
-	Used Python SciPy library to replicate the MATLAB functions and validated Python code using best practice software engineering tools such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
•	Real-Time Cloud Service Development and Deployment
-	Improved and streamlined existing Python modules so that it can be deployed to the Duke University cloud services. 
-	Working on creating Docker Images so that the desired modules can be run on MRI scanner.
-	Participated and learned C++ modules in a 40+ hours workshop by Siemens MRI so that the new functionalities can be implemented directly to the MRI scanner computer.
•	Monte Carlo Simulation on the Cloud Server Computer using Parallel Computing
-	Utilized 30 Linux Server instances to run simulation for solving a research problem.
-	Taken advance of multithreading optionality’s provided by Python and MATLAB.
-	Investigated run time and memory requirements thoroughly before running the entire program.
Image Processing \
•	Absolute and relative calibration of RGB image exploiting integrating sphere.
•	Spatial and frequency domain image enhancement using linear, and non-linear filters.
•	Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) estimation using aperture cover and homogenous area imagery. 
•	Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) estimation using water-land transition image of Landsat 8 OLI.
•	Compressed image using discreate cosine and Fourier transform coding.
Remote Sensing \
•	Landsat 8, Sentinel 2A, Landsat 7, PlanetScope multispectral remote sensing sensor absolute calibration. Used Hyperion hyperspectral imagery to calculate Spectral Band Adjustment Factor (SBAF).
•	NDVI based change detection in the largest mangrove forest in the world using Landsat 8 OLI imagery.
•	Performed relative radiometric calibration of Landsat 7 ETM+ whiskbroom sensor to remove detector level striping noise in the image using histogram modification statistical approach.
